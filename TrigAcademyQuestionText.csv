We begin by placing a special circle, called the <i>Unit Circle</i>, on the coordinate system we explored in the previous section.</p>

The <i>Unit Circle</i> is a circle created by fixing one end of a line of length 1 at the origin of the (x,y) plane, and then starting its other end at the location (x = 1, y = 0).  We then rotate the line, keeping the fixed end at the origin, drawing a circle with a pen positioned at the other end. </p>

A circle is always defined by two factors — its <i>center</i> and its <i>radius</i>. The pattern we just created is a very standard circle, with its center placed at the origin of the xy-plane, and a radius of one unit. Therefore, it is <i>the</i> unit circle.</p>
<p>
You can go ahead and click on the circle at the starting position (1, 0), or at any other position.  A line starting at the origin will appear with its endpoint on the circle.  You can drag the point around the circle in either direction.  In this way you can sweep the point on the circle all the way around, imagining that you are drawing the circle yourself. </p>

</p> 
The reason is that the point's radial line and the positive x-axis forms an angle. As we rotate the point on the circle from the 0° position, this angle gets increasingly larger.  Thus, when ? = 5°, this opening is narrow, and when ? = 75° it is much wider.  When ? = 0°, there is no opening at all, and when ? = 90°, the opening forms a right angle.

3. the <i>openness of the angle</i> formed by the radial line and the positive x-axis.</p>

567,341,53,Extending to Less Familiar Problems,55,Comparing Values,1,"Now, we have landed in a zone where the questions will not be as familiar.
</p>
You will be facing 12 questions in this section, where the given expressions won’t be as familiar as before. For instance, a rotation of 90° or 180° in the negative direction may be involved. Some of these problems may seem a little tricky, since you won’t be able to rely on a relationship you’ve already practiced using before.
</p>
But, you should be able to solve the problems by placing points on the circle and considering their x- and y-coordinates, or by just visualizing these relationships in your mind.
</p>
Are you ready to take the challenge? Again, you don’t have to hurry, since accuracy is a lot more important than speed. Also, this mantra may help you:

</p>
In this section, you will face 10 questions mixing all the different kinds you’ve seen before.
</p>
You can still place as many points on the unit circle as you wish. The challenging part here, however, is that the diagram will <i>not</i> be showing any x-coordinate or y-coordinate values when you place a point on the unit circle, because we want to help you learn to visualize the sines and cosines of the positions corresponding to expressions you will be considering.
</p>
This may make the problems a little harder, and we hope you are ready to give it a try! You can always go back to earlier sections if you’d like more practice with cases where the x- and y-coordinate values are actually shown."
